Follow the steps listed below for using IT2-GSETSK 
1-	Put your data file (.txt) in the Data Folder. The first row must indicate the number of input/s as well as number of output/s (please refer to the sample file in the Data Folder). Please note that interleaved test-train approach in IT2-GSETSK does not need to separate training and testing data.
2-	Set up the f1.txt file in the Config Folder as listed below.
-	Data file path
-	IT2-GSETSK Parameters (please refer to (Ashrafi et al., 2017) for detailed explanation of about parameter set-up). We recommend only playing with Upsilon (variance). All other parameters are recommended to be set as default.   
3-	Get the results at the Output Folder.
